        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>
          I am a motivated individual with a strong interest in coding,
          webdevelopment and problem-solving. Although I may not have
          professional experience in Python and webdevelopment, I have completed
          coursework and personal projects to develop a solid foundation in
          Python programming and webdevelopment.I am seeking opportunities to
          gain industrial experience and work in a supportive environment that
          fosters growth and learning. I am open to internships, entry-level
          positions, and projects where I can contribute and enhance my skills.

            <h3>Health Monitering App</h3>
            <p>
              This project is about monitoring chronic diseases like
              hyperglycemia, hypertension etc. We can upload the patient's test
              readings to find out about the condition of that disease . That
              data is really helpful to doctors to start treatment.
